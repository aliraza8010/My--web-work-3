        <h1>3D Printing</h1>
        <dd>3D printing is fascinating! It's a manufacturing process that creates a three-dimensional object by layering
            material, typically plastic, resin, or metal, based on a digital model. Here's a basic breakdown of how it
            works: </dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <h2>Digital Design:</h2>
                <dd>You start with a digital 3D model created in a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software or by 3D
                    scanning an object.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <dl><h2>Slicing:</h2> <dd>The 3D model is sliced into thin horizontal layers using slicing software. This creates a
                    set of
                    instructions for the 3D printer to follow.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <dl>

            <h2> Printing:</h2> <dd>The 3D printer reads these instructions and starts printing the object layer by layer. It does
            this by
            extruding material (like plastic filament) through a heated nozzle, which then solidifies. The printer moves
            along the X, Y, and Z axes to deposit material precisely according to the digital design.</dd></dl></li>
            <br>
            <li> 
            <dl>
                <h2>Layering:</h2> <dd>Each layer fuses with the previous one as it cools down, gradually building up the object.
            Post-Processing: Depending on the material and the desired finish, you might need to do post-processing.
            This
            could involve removing support structures (if any were used), sanding, painting, or additional treatments to
            achieve the desired surface finish.</dd></dl></li>
